How to create a RESTful CRUD API using Nodejs?

This tutorial will demo how to set up a bare bones 
API using mongodb atlas as the database.

defines the data, and router will contain all 
the route for get, post and delete operation.

app to listen on a specific port.

The get route = localhost:5000/user
The post route = localhost:5000/user
Delete route = localhost:5000/user/generated Id of user from post result
